Listen on UDP socket 

https://www.hacksparrow.com/node-js-udp-server-and-client-example.html

Two udp listener needed:
one to listen to all fligh commands
a second one to listen to response to state commands

What is the best software architecture to implement this? 

First I'll remove the setReceive function. 
Could make it much simpler.
